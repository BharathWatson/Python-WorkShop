1] Regular Expressions -
--------------------------
in computing,a regular expression,also referred to as 'regex' or 'regexp',provides a concise and flexible means for matching
strings of text,such as particular characters,words,or patterns of characters.
a regular expression is written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor.

methods used : -
compile()
copyreg()
enum()
error()
escape()
findall()
finditer()
fullmatch()
functools()
match()
purge()
search()
split()
sre_compile()
sre_parse()
sub()
subn()
template()

regex quick guide :-

^ Matches the beginning of a line
$ Matches the end of the line
. Matches any character
\s Matches whitespace
\S Matches any non-whitespace character
* Repeats a character zero or more times
*? Repeats a character zero or more times
   (non-greedy)
+  Repeats a character one or more times
+? Repeats a character one or more times
   (non-greedy)
[aeiou] Matches a single character in the listed set
[^XYZ] Matches a single character not in the listed set
[a-z0-9] The set of characters can include a range
( Indicates where string extraction is to start
) Indicates where string extraction is to end

2]Networks And Sockets : - 
--------------------------------
what is socket ?
 a socket is an interface for an application to a hosts network stack(part of OS)
 
 after connecting,an application is able ot bidirectionally exchange data with other processes on the same
 or another host.

server side methods in python - 
    socket() - create a new communication end point
    bind() - attach a local address to a Sockets
    listen() - announce willingness to accept connections;give queue size
    accept() - block the caller until a connection attempt arrives
    send()/recv() - send some data over the connection/recieve some data from the connection

client side methods in python - 
    socket() - create a new communication end point
    connect() - actively attempt to establish a connection
    send()/recv() - send some data over the connection/recieve some data from the connection.

3] Extensible Markup Language (XML) :
----------------------------------------------

 4] JSON - Java Script Object Notation
   * it will store minimum data and transfers it into any type of formats.
   * similar to XML
   * it is an in built module
   * methods in JSON : -
   load(),loads(),dump(),dumps()
   load() - load the data
   loads() - load the data as string
   dump() - dump data into other file
   dumps() - dump data as string into other file
   True,False in json are starts with small chars(true,false)

5]Common Gateway Interface:
    to run the program ---> python -m http.server --cgi
